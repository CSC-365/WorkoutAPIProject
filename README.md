# WorkoutAPIProject
Jonny, Nick, and Kenny


Description of the Project:
The workout tracking platform is a web-based application that allows users to track their fitness progress over time. Users can create an account, set fitness goals, and log their workouts, including the exercises performed, sets, reps, weights, and duration. The platform will also provide users with recommendations for workouts based on their fitness goals and previous activity. The app will have a social aspect where users can connect with friends and join groups to share their progress and keep each other motivated. The backend will be built with a relational database, and the API will allow for both read and write operations. Overall, the platform aims to make fitness tracking easier and more effective, helping users achieve their fitness goals.
